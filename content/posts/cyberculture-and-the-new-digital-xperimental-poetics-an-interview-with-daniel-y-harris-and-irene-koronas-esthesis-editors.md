“What has Athens to do with Jerusalem?” the ancient Christian thinker Tertullian pointedly asked in highlighting the apparent incommensurability between the two dominant discourses of his day – philosophy and religious revelation.

Today, considering the disconsolation of the arts and humanities amidst the

digitization of all life and experience as the computer revolution draws ever more inexorably toward a so-called “posthuman” future, we might ask a similar, but seemingly precarious question: “What has Stratford-on-Avon to do with Silicon Valley?”

If you ask Daniel Y. Harris and Irene Koronas, editors of the Santa-Fe based experimental online poetry magazine **[X-Peri](https://x-peri.blogspot.com/), the answer is&hellip;well, they have *everything*to do with each other.

According to Harris, computer algorithms are the new *lingua franca *of our
![](https://cri-hub.com/images/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Irene-Koronas_avatar_1430087620.jpg)Irene Koronas

time, and poetry – if it is to be the genuinely rich and vibrant*vox populi*of this age – must take on the voice of the very machines that are coding our thought and culture.

Just as the visual arts of the modernist period between the world wars (e.g., Dadaism) discovered “found objects” as the grist for a revolutionary transformation of what constitutes both form and matter in esthetic experience,  “so experimental poetry takes with it today the remarkable experimental narrative that uses, and has used, codes, algorithms, internet language – in short, every type of&hellip;meme – as if it has been written cybernetically, or robotically,” [notes Harris](/from-shakespeare-to-search-engines-experimental-poetry-comes-of-age/).

Harris and Koronas, the latter of whom is also a prominent painter as well as a poet, seek to provoke their own twenty-first century artistic upheaval by abolishing the boundaries between traditional modes of literacy and the new digital cultural competence that theorist Gregory Ungar has dubbed “electracy.”  Indeed, they seek, as one of their own pieces of promotional literature asserts, to “reassemble the Western canon as a malware maelstrom of over-competing algorithms and agons modelled on the arch-classic Horatian Ode, “*Exegi monumentum aere perennius*” (I have finished a monument more durable than bronze).“

Harris, a noted Jewish poet, and Koronas, who is a celebrated poet and visual artist, will engage the Denver, Colorado community in a set of “conversations” and “interventions” (i.e., group demonstrations of the grass roots potential of the new digital poetics).

![](https://cri-hub.com/images/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Zorg-Cover-242x300.jpg)The first set of conversations will be held on the University of Denver campus from 4-6 p.m. on Thursday, October 18 in Sturm Hall 480.  There will be a reception for those in attendance from 6-7 pm.  A slightly less formal “TGIF” follow-up will take place form 3-6 pm on Friday, October 19 at the Marion Street Tavern,1223 E. 13th Ave, Denver, CO 80218.

On Thursday they will be joined in conversation with Trace Reddell, Associate Professor of Emergent Digital Practices and W. Scott Howard, Associate Professor of English at the University of Denver.

At both events Harris and Koronas will  be a introducing their latest![](https://cri-hub.com/images/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/declivities-Final-Cover-194x300.jpg) books *The Tryst of Thetica Zorg*(volume 2 in the “Posthuman Series”, published by Blazevox Books out of Buffalo, New York) and *declivities*(volume 3 of “The Grammaton Series” by the same book house).*The Tryst of Thetica Zorg*has been endorsed by the distinguished American poet and critic [Kenneth Goldsmith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Goldsmith), currently at Penn State University, who comments that the work is a “monumental achievement” which, “by siphoning the modernisms of Arno Schmidt, Maurice Roche, and James Joyce through the digital&hellip;exquisitely extends the discourse of endless textuality into the twenty-first century.”

Finally, through incorporating as a *nouveau esthetique*contribution to the academic world on a vast range of sources from Derrida and deconstruction to the literature of so-called  “posthumanism” and “the new materialism,” Harris and Koronas offer a distinctive entry point for poetry and literary theory to be involved in the emergent interdisciplinary discussions known as “the new critical theory.”

_______________________________________________________________________________________

**The editors of *Esthesis*interviewed Harris and Koronas about their project&hellip;****E:**You two have recently teamed together to shakeup the world of contemporary poetry.  In addition to the online e-magazine X-Peri, you both have recently published books.  Finally, you will be talking to different audiences in Denver, Colorado the week of October 16-19 in order to lay out this vision.**H:**When [Irene](https://irenekoronas.com/) and [I](https://danielyharris.com/) met, it was a *coup de foudre*, a confluence of experimentalists unleashing algorithms through the Western Canon. To wax Bloomian with his revisionary ratios, our individual experimentalism began as a *clinamen*or poetic misprision swerving passed the Transcendentalist, then employing*tessera*to complete the Symbolists, *kenosis*to repeat, affirm and undo the Surrealists,*daemonization*****to yeild to the Language Poets, *askesis *as a purgation of the Conceptionalists, to return as the respelled*apophrades*, our melded, new narrative, *xperimentalism.*The shakeup of contemporary poetry has begun. The new poetry features the algorithm as*lingua franca*.

By replacing the “e” of experimentalism with “x,” Irene and I coined the word xperimentalism and launched [X-Peri](https://x-peri.blogspot.com/), whose tagline is “X-Peri is a Stream for High Experimentalism” and whose ethos is “to continue and to expand upon the trajectory of experimentalism in literature, including but not limited to Dadaism, Surrealism, Pataphysics, Fluxus, Oulipo, Postmodernism, Language, Posthumanism, Deconstruction, Digital, Flarf, Haptic, Found and Spoetry, Vispo, Ergodic Literature, Asemic, Concrete, Conceptual, Postprojective, Postdata,  Uncreative Writing, Algorithmics and beyond.” In three years, with over 300 publications, X-Peri has published some of the most renowned experimentalists of the era.

Irene’s and my xperimental syncretism led to the creation of our [Posthuman](https://danielyharris.com/the-posthuman-series/) and [Grammaton](https://irenekoronas.com/the-grammaton-series/) Series. Irene’s 3rd volume in her Grammaton Series, *[declivities](https://www.blazevox.org/index.php/Shop/new-releases/declivities-by-irene-koronas-515/)*(BlazeVOX, 2018) and my 2nd volume in my Posthuman Series,*[The Tryst of Thetica Zorg](https://www.blazevox.org/index.php/Shop/new-releases/the-tryst-of-thetica-zorg-by-daniel-y.-harris-514/)*(BlazeVOX, 2018) were recently published and will be the featured texts at three events in Denver Colorado the week of October 16-19.

We will be disseminating our vision for a new poesis on October 17 at an informal gathering of scholars and students at [Bar Max](https://barmax.co/), hosted by [Adam Graves](https://webapp.msudenver.edu/directory/profile.php?uName=agrave13), Professor of Philosophy at Metropolitan State University of Denver. On October 18, we will be hosted by [Carl Raschke](https://carlraschke.com/), Professor of Religious Studies at the University of Denver and the [Religious Studies Department](https://www.du.edu/ahss/religiousstudies/news/index.html#/?i=1)  at the University of Denver, presenting a reading, discussion and conversation/intervention entitled [Electracy And The New Digital Poetics–Conversations/Interventions](https://cri-hub.com/2018/09/21/electracy-and-the-new-digital-poetics-conversations-interventions-with-daniel-y-harris-irene-koronas-and-others/). On October 19, we will perform and theatrically render excerpts from *declivities*and *The Tryst of Thetica Zorg *at the [Marion Street Tavern](https://marionstreet-tavern.com/), hosted by the [CRI Hub](https://cri-hub.com/).**E:**Can you explain somewhat briefly what your vision of “experimental poetry”, or a new digital poetics might be, and in what ways it challenges so radically the prevailing norms?

****H: **The Prevailing Norm 

****With the exception of a trajectory of rarefied experimentalism from Dadaism to Surrealism to Language Poetry, Uncreative Writing and Conceptualism, the prevailing norms of contemporary poetry focus on the restrictions of the formulaic lyric, replete with a self-referentiality constrained by identity narratives and contained, by and large, by an acceptable lexicon of common use words and expressions. Stasis and *déjà-dit*rather than invention and novelty are extolled.

Xperimentalism: The Challenge      

Computer algorithms such as the Low Orbit Ion Cannon (LOIC) and the High Orbit Ion Cannon (HOIC), examples of the common DDoS attack script, are the new *lingua franca*of an xperimental poetry whose intent it is to create infinite variability as the new narrative. Algorithmics facilitate a siphoning from a trajectory of experimental literature from Dadaism to Language Poetry to Conceptualism by launching an aporia at the center of a plurivocity, part *totum simul*and part *anagnorisis*. Xperimentalism is a praxis which seeks to reassemble the Western canon as a malware maelstrom of over-competing algorithms and agons modelled on the arch-classic Horatian Ode, “*Exegi monumentum aere perennius*” (I have finished a monument more durable than bronze).

This “bronze” is capable of translating a symbol as infecund as a two character Thai sequence into a hyperlink as linguistically innovative as the Derridean lexicon and an AI algorithm constructing a CGI with an fMRI scan/ inventing the new narrative hexDump(“TELOUT”, buffer, len) using an HTTP language featuring computer viruses such as ILOVEYOU, Code Red, Melissa, Sasser, Zeus, Conficker, Stuxnet, Mydoom, CryptoLocker and Flashback. Below is an excerpt from*The Tryst of Thetica Zorg*, entitled “Exergue I,” by which the algorithm as new *lingua franca*is actualized.

**K: **The xperimental ethos of my work is a hybrid of post-Language and advanced, high minimalism: a multifarious post-narrative strain to achieve a new aesthetic augmented by digital bricolage and algorithmic assemblage, inventing the grammaton. I meld the impasse of a posthuman poetics with an orthodox spirit. No grammaton cleaves to a single narrative account but rather to an infinite array of variables, memed and burrowed from matrices comprised of *gematria*, the fibonacci code, hagiography and iconography. This grammaton is fashioned from a panerotism reconciling the hyperlinks of a retromanic divine realm with a feminine sensibility. This new, digital poetics secretes a gloss from the new digital poetics as holy writ. Below is an excerpt from*declivities*, entitled “incise” by which an advanced, high minimalism is actualized.

*from *declivities*(BlazeVOX, 2018), P.35

**E:**You have identified this new form of experimental poetry with the general transition of much of arts and culture toward something known as “posthumanism”. You have also associated your work with this trend. Can you elaborate?

**H: **Posthumanism, as it informs both [The Rapture of Eddy Daemon](https://www.blazevox.org/index.php/Shop/new-releases/the-rapture-of-eddy-daemon-by-daniel-y.-harris-456/) (BlazeVOX, 2016) and [The Tryst of Thetica Zorg](https://www.blazevox.org/index.php/Shop/new-releases/the-tryst-of-thetica-zorg-by-daniel-y.-harris-514/)(BlazeVOX, 2018), in my [Posthuman Series](https://danielyharris.com/the-posthuman-series/), is praxis, a shift in the humanistic paradigm and its anthropocentric *Weltanschauung*. Posthumanism’s epistemology is a post/meta/trans, enacted through its emergent ontology and critique of biocentrism. The xperimentalism at the center of my Posthuman Series is Posthumanism’s rhizomatic outline: dynamic, mutant, shifting. The “sonnets” of *The Rapture of Eddy Daemon*and the “exergues” of *The Tryst of Thetica Zorg*contain a dramaturgy of post-biological AIs rendered as Miraibots and DDoS viruses: Eddy Daemon, Thetica Zorg, The Imps, Gregor & Khôra Samsa, Orb Oran & Salvador Dracu and Maximillian Pissante &   Sophia Latrinus.

Each posthuman protagonist breaks away from hegemonic essentialism by augmenting traditional narrative forms with cybernetics, genomics, neural interfaces, algorithmics, molecular nanotechnology (MNT), whole brain emulation (WBE), IMs (instant messaging), IRCs (internet relay chat) and (MMORPGs) massively multiplayer online role-playing games. The era of the anthropocene with its complex cartography goes viral.

> In *“Exergue I” of *The Tryst of Thetica Zorg*, Thetica Zorg has hybridized her/his “Godbot” digital torso with a DDoS virus, partially scripted as “*echo ipconfig/release_all>>c:windowswimn32.bat*.” Thetica Zorg performs *autofellatio *and “The Imps are born by remote *homo ludens*” (both the book, *Homo Ludens*, Huizinga, 1938 as well as inborn play) “and *CνB decoupled*” (a cosmic neutrino background at a temperature of roughly 1.95 [K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin).), thus “in redshifts.” Finally, “in thresh interfaces” internet “files are cast” as “WIN-BUGS FIX.EXE” and the virus inseminates the Western Canon of Literature. (WinBUGS are the successor to BUGS, the first program to perform Bayesian analysis of complex models using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, and provided access to the functions of BUGS through a Windows interface.) Transversal alliances between human and posthuman agents are cast.*“Exergue I,” *The Tryst of Thetica Zorg,*Lines: 6-9

files are cast as WIN-BUGS FIX.EXE*in thresh interfaces.

The “Zorg” protagonists are glossolalists, syphoning their lexicon from English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Hebrew, Aramaic, Arabic, Greek, Latin, Russian and the computer programming languages, HTML, BASIC, C, C++, COBOL and Java. Mixed with this Posthuman *Migdal Bā**ḇ**ēl*are enumerative and extremal combinatorics, optical physics and thermal dynamics, all melded in a bricolage of the kabbalistic concepts of *notarikon*(letter combinations), *gematria *(assigning numerical values to letters) and *temurah *(sentence and word rearrangements.) “Exergue I” of *The Tryst of Thetica Zorg*, concludes with lines 23-27, a posthuman network interface burning “*heterocosms**.*”  **> Is *tout autre*, not a *haecceitas*that gewgaws

**H:**Our project, Xperimentalism, as manifested by X-Peri, The Post Human & Grammaton Series, as well as through our individual collections, have received the highest critical acclaim, critical reviews and support from renowned poets and humanities scholars. We have yet to procure interest from the “geek world,” but with events such as [Electracy And The New Digital Poetics–Conversations/Interventions](https://cri-hub.com/2018/09/21/electracy-and-the-new-digital-poetics-conversations-interventions-with-daniel-y-harris-irene-koronas-and-others/) in Denver, Colorado in October, 2018, we envision attracting a brand new audience that may include those highly coveted “geeks.”
