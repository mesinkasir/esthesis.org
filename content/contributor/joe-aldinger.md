teaches at Lynchburg College in Virginia, specializing in sixteenth and seventeenth-century poetry and drama. His interdisciplinary work focuses on the relationship between literature, subjectivity, and politics. His dissertation project, “Religious Melancholy and the Lyric Subject: the Politics of Conscience,” traces a melancholic strand of early modern selfhood, which considers the ways in which the Reformation left individuals vulnerable to coercion. He is the Assistant Technical Editor of the *Journal for Culture and Religious Theory.*  His work has also been generously supported by The Folger Shakespeare Library’s “Researching the Archive” seminar.  He holds a Ph.D. candidate at University at Buffalo, SUNY.
